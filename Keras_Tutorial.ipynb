        " The Poker Hand database consists of 1,025,010 instances of poker hands. Each instance is an example of a poker hand consisting of five cards drawn from a standard deck of 52 cards. Each card is described using two attributes (suit and rank), for a total of 10 features. There is one Class attribute that describes the Poker Hand. The order of cards is important, which is why there are 480 possible Royal Flush hands as compared to 4 (one for each suit  explained in more detail below):\n",

We can see how the matrix looks like by using head() method.\n",

Later we convert output vector to one hot vector since its a multiclass classification. "
